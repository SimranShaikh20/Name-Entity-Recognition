# Name Entity Recognition (NER) Project

## Description

This project demonstrates **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** using **SpaCy**, a powerful Natural Language Processing (NLP) library. NER is the process of identifying and classifying key elements in a text, such as names of persons, organizations, locations, dates, and more. This project uses SpaCy’s pre-trained models to analyze text input and extract named entities, making it an essential tool for various NLP tasks, such as document analysis, information retrieval, and chatbots.

The goal of this project is to showcase how easy it is to implement NER and use it for analyzing text data, with a user-friendly interface through Jupyter Notebooks. This can serve as a base for developing more advanced NER solutions and integrating them into larger applications.

## Installation

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory:
   
   ```bash
   cd NameEntityRecognition

## Install Dependencies:

Make sure to install all the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Optional) Download SpaCy Language Models:

If you haven't already, download the SpaCy language models required for NER analysis. For this project, we will use the en_core_web_sm English language model:

bash
Copy code
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
How to Use
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

Launch the Jupyter notebook to run the project:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook NameEntityRecognition.ipynb
Follow the Cells in the Notebook:

Provide your text input for NER analysis.
Run the analysis by executing the notebook cells.
View and interpret the extracted named entities.
