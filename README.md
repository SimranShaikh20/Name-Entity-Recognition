# Name Entity Recognition (NER) Project

## Description
This project demonstrates **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** using **SpaCy**, a powerful Natural Language Processing (NLP) library. NER identifies and classifies key elements in a text, such as names of persons, organizations, locations, dates, and more. By leveraging SpaCy’s pre-trained models, this project provides an easy-to-use interface to analyze text and extract named entities. This capability is crucial for tasks such as document analysis, information retrieval, and chatbot development.

The goal of this project is to showcase the simplicity of implementing NER with SpaCy and its potential as a foundation for more advanced NLP applications.
